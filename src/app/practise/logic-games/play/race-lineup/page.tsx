      explanation:
        "If P is in position 4, then M and N must be adjacent (positions 3 and 5, or 2 and 3, or 5 and 6). If M were in position 2, then N would have to be in position 3. But that would mean P (position 4) and N (position 3) are adjacent, which creates a valid arrangement. Since we're looking for what CANNOT be true, D is not the answer. The correct answer is E: N cannot be in position 3 because then M would have to be in position 2 or 4, but P is already in position 4.",
